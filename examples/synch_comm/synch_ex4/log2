KisTA INFO: Global simulation time limit settled to 10 s

Warning: KisTA: Source address cannot be resolved by the end of elaboration because no source (task) name was provided to the channel

Warning: KisTA:: Link my_fifo_buf not resolved.
In file: /home/emanuele/Kista/kista/kista//include/link_t.hpp:163

Warning: KisTA: Scheduler scheduler1 was not assigned to a PE. The scheduler was automatically mapped to an automatically created processing element scheduler1.PE_0, created without network interface.
In file: scheduler.cpp:1313

Info: KisTA: Channel my_fifo_buf: message size = 32 bits (inferred from data type)

Warning: KisTA: No communication resource has been declared in the KisTA model.KisTA will not try to associate a resource and so a physical link to the logical link of the channel my_fifo_buf. System-level communications have no penalty.

Scheduler scheduler1: Taskset assigned:
	task1, task2

Warning: KisTA: More than one tasks assigned to the scheduler with the same priority
In file: scheduler.cpp:1119
2 tasks assigned to scheduler scheduler1 with priority 1
Tasks are: task1, task2

Info: KisTA: PE scheduler1.PE_0 executing Scheduler scheduler1 has no associated network interface. No preparation of (static) communication scheduling is done or required.
