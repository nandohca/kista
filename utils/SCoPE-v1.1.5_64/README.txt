This folder contains a static and minimal version for 64 bits of the
scope-g++ and opcost compilation and annotation tools of SCOPE.
Other files, sources and libraries coming with SCoPE have been
not included to overload as less as possible the KisTA distribution.

The aim is to save the KisTA user the compilation of this part of the 
SCoPE tool.

For a full functional installation of SCoPE, please refer to SCoPE website

	www.teisa.unican.es/scope

and to their authors.
