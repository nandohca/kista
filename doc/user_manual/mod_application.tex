KisTA provides a C++-API for enabling the modelling of a rich type of
concurrent applications.
Essentially, KisTA enables the modelling of concurrent applications through
\emph{tasks} and \emph{communication\&synchronization channels} with a specific semantics.
%
KisTA is oriented to the modelling and performance analysis of predictable systems.
In this sense, KisTA supports application models used in real-time and Models-of-Computation
theories.

Following, these two main element types are explained.
Later, examples corresponding to the real-time and to the MoC cases are shown.
