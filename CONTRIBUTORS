Fernando Herrera:
	So far, the only author contributing code to KisTA library
	fernanhc@kth.se
        nandohca@yahoo.es

However, there are other people which I consider directly or indirectly involved:

Ingo Sander (KTH):
	Co-author of first publication associated to KisTA library.
	Some ideas on the library, such as adding the throughput measurements
        and detection of the stationary phase.

Katrhin Rosvall (KTH):
	Because the discussions with her let me understand in depth 
	the predictable model supported by her analytical DSE tool,
	and so enable an accurate support of it (only with rounding
        deviations) by KisTA.

Edoardo Paone (PoliMi):
	Co-author of the KisTA version of the VAD example
	Many comments which helped to debug the library during the development
        of a JAS-DSE methodology where KisTA has been employed.
	
Hector Posadas, Daniel Calvo,  Eugenio Villar, and other people of University of Cantabria:
	Because several features of KisTA are based on features from
	SCoPE tool, which either i adapted to reproduce for the KisTA purposes
	(e.g. the XML interface supporting HSDF, or a dialect with PEs, 
        or implemented in a different way (e.g. XML interface based on libxml2)
        and had the chance to discuss and learn from them.
